    <title>Billy "Joel" Evans' Musical Mishap</title>

    <h1>Jazz Musician Confident That The Audience 'Totally Got' That Random Note He Hit by Accident</h1>
        <p>
            After a particularly ambitious solo, pianist Billy "Joel" Evans confirmed that the out-of-time and out-of-key lick he repeated for approximately 2 minutes was, in fact, "a deliberate exploration of harmonic and rhythmic dissonance." Sources close to the jazz quartet report that Evans has since referred to the moment as "avant-garde expression" at least six times, usually while sweating profusely. When asked for further elaboration, Evans quickly redirected to talk about his upcoming experimental jazz fusion album, "Kind of Blue-Red-White-Yellow (Vol. 2)".
