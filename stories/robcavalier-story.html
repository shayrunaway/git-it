    <h1>NASA Accidentally Launches Manatee Into Orbit, Calls It “A Learning Experience”</h1>
    <p>
       According to a press thing I skimmed, the manatee rolled onto a platform labelled “not a rocket” and then it was a rocket actually. 
          Astronauts report the manatee is chill and keeps bumping into buttons that make nice beeping sounds.
           NASA says they will bring it home after “a few laps,” which sounds fair because space is basically a giant lazy river.
            If this goes well, they might try a turtle next.</p>
